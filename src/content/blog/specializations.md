Front end platform engineering encompasses a wide range of interconnected specializations, though not every specialization will correspond one-to-one to a job role. Depending on the size and structure of each company, there may be one or several teams dedicated to particular subsets of these areas. Additionally, each front end platform engineer may choose a few areas to focus in, depending on their interests and the needs of their projects or company.

Here’s a closer look at each specialization:

### Accessibility

Accessibility, often abbreviated a11y, focuses on making web applications usable for everyone regardless of physical or cognitive abilities. By adhering to international standards such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), specialists in web accessibility aim to create digital experiences that are perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for all users, regardless of their browsing context or adaptive technologies they may use, such as screen readers or voice recognition software. Focusing on web accessibility promotes a better web experience and underscores an organizations’s commitment to diversity and inclusivity.

### Design Systems

Design Systems focuses on crafting the standardized set of design principles, patterns, colors, and UI components to unify the experience across an organization’s digital products. Investing in design systems enhances brand identity, promotes accessibility, facilitates predictability in UX, and reduces development time and costs by reusing established components and guidelines. Design Systems Engineers are experts in identifying patterns to create reusable abstractions and partner closely with Product Designers and Brand Designers. Additionally, they are often knowledgeable about accessibility because the best design systems are accessible by default. Some tools Design Systems Engineers use might be Figma for prototyping and collaborating with design, Storybook for component documentation and development, and Chromatic for visual testing.

### Developer Experience (DX)

Developer Experience (DX) is the domain that is dedicated to optimizing workflows, productivity, and satisfaction for other software engineers. An important part of DX is monitoring essential metrics in order to identify and mitigate potential bottlenecks in the software development lifecycle. DX engineers might work on build tool plugins that improve the efficiency or speed of local development environments. They also often own linters and formatting tools, such as ESLint and Prettier, which ensure code consistency, prevent errors, and maintain code hygiene. DX also includes maintaining testing frameworks that involve numerous testing strategies, such as static code analysis, unit tests, integration tests, and visual regression tests. Additionally, it’s important for DX engineers to stay up to date on the latest language, framework, and package features, as they are often the ones coordinating major upgrades.

### Infrastructure

Front End Infrastructure is the area that focuses on building and maintaining foundational tools that support the deployment process of web applications. Infrastructure engineers work on setting up automated build processes, continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, and development environments that are consistent and reliable. They also work on the optimization of assets and resources, such as images and scripts, to improve application performance and user experience. This includes implementing strategies for efficient bundling, minification, and caching.

### Internationalization and Localization

Internationalization and localization, often abbreviated as i18n and l10n respectively, focus on adapting content and interfaces to various languages, cultures, and regions. This adaptation process encompasses a variety of considerations, including the integration of different writing modes (such as left-to-right or right-to-left text), the use of appropriate currencies, and the correct representation of units of measurement to align with local practices. Furthermore, it involves the translation of text content, the adjustment of spelling to match regional variations, and the culturally sensitive use of emoji. These efforts not only enhance the user experience for a global audience but also ensure that web applications are inclusive and accessible to users from different cultural backgrounds.
