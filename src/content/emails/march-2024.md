Hey everyone!

Hope March was awesome for you, and the leap forward for daylight savings time wasn't too disruptive. On my end this month, I officially launched the [frontendplatform.dev](http://frontendplatform.dev) website and kicked off the blog, starting with two new posts: [What is Front End Platform Engineering?](https://frontendplatform.dev/blog/overview/) and [Front End Platform Engineering Specializations](https://frontendplatform.dev/blog/specializations/). Eager for your thoughts, so dive in when you have a moment!

Now, let's rewind and chat about the cool stuff that went down in March.

## March Highlights

- [**Storybook 8 is finally here!**](https://storybook.js.org/blog/storybook-8/) The next major version comes with a bunch of new features, most notably the [new Visual Tests add-on](https://www.chromatic.com/blog/visual-tests-addon/). This new workflow accelerates your development feedback cycle by removing the need to wait for CI. Instead, you can run visual tests locally. Version 8 also includes improved controls autogeneration (docgen), rearchitected Vite support, and faster test builds.
- Thereâ€™s a new core web vital in town: [**Interaction to Next Paint (INP)**](https://web.dev/blog/inp-cwv-launch). INP is the successor to First Input Delay (FID). Both assess responsiveness, but FID only measures the _first_ interaction on a page while INP considers _all_ page interactions. In other words, FID is for load responsiveness whereas INP is for overall responsiveness. [Learn more about INP here.](https://web.dev/articles/inp)
- Weâ€™re officially in the era of X but written in Rust. The latest development is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="notion-link-token notion-focusable-token notion-enable-hover" href="https://twitter.com/rolldown_rs/status/1766013359932297275?s=20"><strong>Rolldown</strong></a>, a lightning fast JavaScript bundler that is compatible with the Rollup API. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="notion-link-token notion-focusable-token notion-enable-hover" href="https://twitter.com/jpschroeder/status/1766115866859446477">This tweet from Justin Schroeder</a> explains the significance of Rolldown. Vite fans, build tool nerds, and front end infra engineers pay attention ðŸ‘€
- From the team at Deno comes [**JSR - the JavaScript Registry**](https://deno.com/blog/jsr_open_beta), a new package registry that aims to address the growing gaps with npm and modern web development practices. JSR is made for TypeScript + ESModules and works with any runtime.

## Tooling Roundup

- ðŸ¥³ [Happy 3rd birthday Astro](https://twitter.com/astrodotbuild/status/1768646279230279849)! Astro had a busy month, releasing [version 4.5,](https://astro.build/blog/astro-450/) [Astro DB](https://astro.build/blog/astro-db/), and an [updated developer portal](https://astro.build/blog/dev-portal/).
- [Tailwind 4 enters the alpha stage](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4-alpha) with a new engine thatâ€™s optimized for speed and an integration with Lightning CSS.
- [TypeScript 5.4 is here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-4/), with smarter control-flow analysis in closures, the `NoInfer` utility type, types for `Object.groupBy` and `Map.groupBy`, and more.
- [Shadcn launches Blocks](https://ui.shadcn.com/blocks), ready-made layouts and page components that are fully responsive, accessible, and composable.
- [Biome 1.6](https://biomejs.dev/blog/biome-v1-6/) is shipped, including new lint rules, partial support for Astro, Svelte, and Vue files, support for `biome.jsonc` as a configuration file, an easier migration path from Prettier, and more.
