Hey front end platform fam!

Hope you all had a lovely April. I‚Äôm definitely noticing myself getting happier as the days get longer. On the front end platform side of things, I worked on a tooling overview page for the site. You can get a sense of the current ecosystem and browse by category. [Check it out here](https://frontendplatform.dev/tooling/).

Now let‚Äôs review what happened this past month.

## April Highlights

- [The next major version of ESLint is here.](https://eslint.org/blog/2024/04/eslint-v9.0.0-released/) ESLint v9 makes the new flat config the default. Check out the [migration guide](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/migrate-to-9.0.0) for the full list of breaking changes.
- The React team released [the Beta for React 19](https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19). There‚Äôs several new hooks and APIs, such as `use`, `useOptimistic`, `useActionState`, as well as support for Server Components. React 19 also improves existing APIs, e.g. simplifying `forwardRef` and context providers. Check out the [React 19 Beta upgrade guide](https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19-upgrade-guide) as well as [the `types-react-codemod` repo](https://github.com/eps1lon/types-react-codemod/) for codemods. The React team recommends [upgrading to 18.3](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#1830-april-25-2024) as an intermediate step, which adds warnings for deprecated APIs.
- April was a big month for Betas. On top of the React 19 Beta, we also have the [TypeScript 5.5 Beta](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-5-beta/) which brings us the much awaited [Inferred Type Predicates](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/57465) feature ([deep dive on the making of this feature](https://effectivetypescript.com/2024/04/16/inferring-a-type-predicate/)). 5.5 also disables a number of options that were marked as [deprecated in 5.0](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/51909). They will do nothing starting 5.5 and [be removed entirely in 6.0](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/51000).
- There‚Äôs a new [TC39 proposal for JavaScript Signals](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-signals) that aims to provide infrastructure for managing reactive application state. Give it a try in this [JS playground](https://jsbin.com/safoqap/6/edit?html,output).
