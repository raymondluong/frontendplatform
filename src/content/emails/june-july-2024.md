Happy summer everyone!

I am loving the hotter weather and longer days. I was feeling a touch disengaged from the world of software engineering, but after celebrating Pride and taking a trip to Europe, I am back and feeling re-energized.

Looks like the [2023 State of JS results](https://2023.stateofjs.com/en-US/) came out recently. I always love these surveys as they provide an interesting pulse on where the industry is headed. Shoutout to Vite for sweeping half of the awards â€“ most adopted, highest retention, and most loved library. If you are a front end platform engineer and you havenâ€™t tried Vite out yet, youâ€™re missing out!

The front end frameworks section is also always interesting to me. React continues to maintain its dominance, though retention and interest continue to drop. Such is the lifecycle of any dominant player in a market. Its prevalence in the industry means that itâ€™s still a valuable skill to learn. Iâ€™m curious where weâ€™ll be in a few years and Iâ€™m personally going to tinker with Svelte, Solid, and htmx on the side.

On the meta-frameworks side, Next is the dominant player, though Astro is making moves. I use Astro to build all my personal websites and find the experience incredibly seamless. Looking at runtimes, Node is still the king, though Bun is gaining traction, winning the most write-ins award.

Testing continues to be fairly fragmented. Jest, Storybook, Cypress, Vitest, and Testing Library are all major players and each can serve slightly different purposes. I personally would love to see some convergence here so we can focus on writing tests vs debating how to write tests.

What do you think about the State of JS results? Let me know!
