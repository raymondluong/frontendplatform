Hey everyone!

May has blessed us all with such beautiful weather ‚òÄÔ∏è This month, I had the incredible opportunity to spend a weekend in the breathtaking Yosemite National Park. The stunning landscapes, towering sequoias, and serene waterfalls made for an unforgettable experience. If you haven‚Äôt visited Yosemite yet, I highly recommend adding it to your travel list‚Äîit‚Äôs truly a natural wonder!

On the tech front, there have been a bunch of exciting updates, especially in React and CSS. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at what‚Äôs new and noteworthy.

## May Highlights

- React Conf happened! The biggest announcement was the open sourcing of [React Compiler](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler). There were also a bunch of talks on what to expect with React 19 and React Server Components. [Check out the recap for a full summary.](https://react.dev/blog/2024/05/22/react-conf-2024-recap)
- The team at MUI is releasing [Pigment CSS](https://mui.com/blog/introducing-pigment-css/), a zero-runtime CSS-in-JS package that generates colocated styles to their own CSS files at build-time. Works with React Server Components and is more performant than existing CSS-in-JS solutions out there, like Emotion and Styled Components.
- The Angular team also had a major launch with the release of version 18, which includes experimental zoneless, a new home for developers on Angular.dev, and more. [Check out the full notes here](https://blog.angular.dev/angular-v18-is-now-available-e79d5ac0affe).
